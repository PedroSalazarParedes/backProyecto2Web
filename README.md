## Description
This repository contains the source code of the Proyect Ufree. In this project, Daniela Rocha Torres and I, Juan Felipe Ramos, tried to help those groups of friends that want to know which of its members are available in a specific range of time.

## Deployment
The user can directly visit the website (hosted in HerokuApp) on http://ufree.herokuapp.com/ or can deploy locally this project, installing all the dependencies with the `npm install`command. After this, the deployment is completed when the user runs `npm run build` in the front folder and when, finally, the user executes `npm start` (a command that executes `nodemon index.js`) in the same folder where the index.js is located. The backend services are externally hosted in http://ufree2.herokuapp.com/.
